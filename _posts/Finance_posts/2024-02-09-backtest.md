Basics about lot sizes and pip values
--------------------------

I have $10,000 in my trading account, and I am happy to risk 2% on each trade. For example, I see that I want to enter a 
position at 1.2630 for a currency pair. I want to place my stop loss 20 pips below at 1.2610. So my risk on this trade is 20 pips.
Now I need to know what my position size will be, where I am risking no more than 1% of my overall account balance of $10,000.

In this trade, the math would look something like this:
$10,000 x 1% = $100
$100 / 20 pips = $5 per pip

1 lot is worth $10 per pip, so I would need to trade 0.5 lots to keep my risk at 1% of my account balance.

Backtesting
--------------------------

The initial parameters for the RSI strategy were

* RSI period: 14
* Overbought level: 70
* Oversold level: 30
* Time Frame: 15 minute candles 
* Currency Pair: GBP/USD
* Initial Capital: $10,000
* Stop Loss: 0.95 * Price 
* Take Profit: 1.1 * Price
* Commission: 0.002

The RSI strategy is not very profitable in this case. The RSI strategy sells when the market has been overbought, 
anticipating a reversal, however in most cases, the trend continues in the direction of the overbought market. 
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its 
strength on days when prices go down.

Testing the levels again for the RSI strategy to find the optimal parameters for RSI to maximise equity given the trading
data. It is seen that the highest equity is present when the RSI overbought and oversold levels are 80 and 15 respectively.

The backtests is becoming more and more overit to the training data. A balance needs to be struck between using the 
most optimal parameters and maximising for equity. From the given data, only 2 trades have been carried out. This is not
exactly optimal as well because realistically, a trading strategy should be able to carry out more trades. Furthermore, 
the strategy should be able to carry out trades in different market conditions. An extreme level for overbought and 
oversold levels would also mean that the strategy would not be able to carry out trades in most conditions.

Different time frames can be used as well for the RSI strategy. The 15-minute time frame is not the only time frame that
can be tested.

I don't think that candlestick/bar data as training data for a Machine Learning model would work either because the
series of price is not identically and independently distributed. There is often a form of memory associated with these
price series. Maybe looking at the returns per time step would be a better approach because the logarithm of returns 
better approach a normal distribution. To perform a stationary transformation to stabilise the mean and variance of the
series could be a good idea as well.
