In this post I will be using XGBoost to predict the outcome of a Premier League football club. Some constraints on the data
used include: trying to predict and classify the outcome of premier league games. The data is taken from [here](https://www.football-data.co.uk/).

The main data used include the betting odds from various bookmakers, the home and away team and the referre for each game.
