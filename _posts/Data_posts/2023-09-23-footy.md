In this post I will be using XGBoost to predict the outcome of a Premier League football club. Some constraints on the data
used include: trying to predict and classify the outcome of premier league games. The data is taken from [here](https://www.football-data.co.uk/).

The main data used include the betting odds from various bookmakers, the home and away team and the referee of the game.

The first XGBoost model used will be a simple model with no hyperparameter tuning. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import xgboost as xgb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import balanced_accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, make_scorer  # for scoring during cross validation
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV  # cross validation
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay  # creates and draws a confusion matrix
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
