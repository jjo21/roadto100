Imagine you're trying to figure out the probability of something happening, like whether it'll 
rain tomorrow or not. Bayes' Theorem is like your secret weapon for updating your beliefs or predictions as you gather 
new information. It helps you make better decisions in uncertain situations.

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It's named after Thomas Bayes, an 
18th-century mathematician and philosopher. The theorem relates conditional probabilities, which means the probability 
of something happening given that something else has already happened.

Here's the formula:
$$
\textup{P(H} \mid \textup{E)} = \frac{\textup{P(H)P(E} \mid \textup{H)}}{\textup{P(E)}}
$$

The above Q-Q plots and their respective [Kernel Density Estimates](https://jjo21.github.io/roadto100/2023-08-13-kde/) are shown. 
Let's take a closer look at [6]. [6] has a concave-convex shape, if we look at its corresponding KDE, we can see that the distribution
has a sharper peak, meaning less outliers. See if you can look at the rest of the examples and decide for yourself!

Remember that the interpretation of a Q-Q plot is not black and white. It's about assessing the degree of departure from normality. 
Sometimes, a slight curvature might not be a big concern, but if it's extreme, it can indicate a significant departure from normality. 
It also depends on how important it is for your data to follow a normal distribution. 
For example, if you wish to follow up with a hypothesis test on the data which assumes normality, you may wish to reconsider 
a non-parametric hypothesis test instead.
