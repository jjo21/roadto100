Imagine you've collected some data, and you want to know if it follows a normal distribution. Q-Q plots, which stands for Quantile-Quantile plots, provide you with visual and intuitive insights into whether the data follows a normal distribution. 

Think of it like a visual check-up for your data. In a Q-Q plot, you're basically comparing your data's distribution to what a normal distribution should look like.

**Here's how you make a Q-Q plot** You start by sorting your data in ascending order. Then, you calculate the quantiles of your data. 
These are the data points that divide your dataset into equal-sized portions. For example, the median is the 50th percentile. 
Next, you calculate the expected quantiles for a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation as your data.
You plot the actual quantiles from your data against the expected quantiles from the normal distribution on a graph.


If your data points lie close to a straight diagonal line, it means your data is pretty close to a normal distribution. If they deviate, it suggests non-normality.

Q-Q plots are great because they give you a visual way to spot deviations from normality. If your points deviate from the straight line, it could mean your data is skewed, has heavy tails, or follows a different distribution altogether.

Remember, it's not a definitive "yes or no" test for normality, but it's a useful tool to get a sense of how close your data is to being normally distributed.

Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of interpreting Q-Q plots:

* Straight Line: As I mentioned earlier, a straight line is a good sign. It means your data's quantiles match up well with what's expected from a normal distribution. This suggests your data is close to normal.
* Concave: Right Skewed Distribution - Positive Skewness (Most of the data is concentrated on the left) 
* Convex: Left Skewed Distribution - Negative Skewness (Most of the data is concentrated on the right) 
* Convex - Concave: Heavier Tails (Distribution has more outliers)
* Concave - Convex: Lighter Tails (Distribution has fewer outliers) 

Here are some Q-Q plots based on some arbitrary data. Try identifying for yourself which of the plots are convex-concave and which are concave-convex!

The above Q-Q plots and their respective [Kernel Density Estimates](https://jjo21.github.io/roadto100/2023-08-13-kde/) are shown. 
Let's take a closer look at [6]. [6] has a concave-convex shape, if we look at its corresponding KDE, we can see that the distribution
has a sharper peak, meaning less outliers. See if you can look at the rest of the examples and decide for yourself!

Remember that the interpretation of a Q-Q plot is not black and white. It's about assessing the degree of departure from normality. 
Sometimes, a slight curvature might not be a big concern, but if it's extreme, it can indicate a significant departure from normality. 
It also depends on how important it is for your data to follow a normal distribution. 
For example, if you wish to follow up with a hypothesis test on the data which assumes normality, you may wish to reconsider 
a non-parametric hypothesis test instead.
