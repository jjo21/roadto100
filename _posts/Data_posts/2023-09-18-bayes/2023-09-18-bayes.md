Imagine you're trying to figure out the probability of something happening, like whether it'll 
rain tomorrow or not. Bayes' Theorem is like your secret weapon for updating your beliefs or predictions as you gather 
new information. It helps you make better decisions in uncertain situations.

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It's named after Thomas Bayes, an 
18th-century mathematician and philosopher. The theorem relates conditional probabilities, which means the probability 
of something happening given that something else has already happened.

Here's the formula:
$$
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(H)P(E \mid H)}{P(E)}
$$
where:
* $P(H \mid E)$ is the probability of hypothesis $H$ given the event $E$ has occurred. This is called the posterior.
* $P(H)$ is the probability of hypothesis $H$ being true (regardless of the event $E$). This is called the prior.
* $P(E \mid H)$ is the probability of the event $E$ given that hypothesis $H$ is true. This is called the likelihood.
* $P(E)$ is the probability of the event $E$ occurring (regardless of the hypothesis $H$). This is called the marginal.

To understand the formula better, we can use the following example. Suppose we work in a company and know that 80% of 
the people belong in the data science department and 20% in the marketing department (very unlikely for a real company). 
__What is the probability that a new colleague you just observed in the break room is from marketing?__ 
From the frequentist view, we would say that the probability is 20%. However, we can also use Bayes' theorem to 
calculate the probability given the evidence that our new colleague is extroverted.

Given some extra information, we are able to represent the entire "space" of all probabilities as a square and divide 
up the people in the company based on their job and personality.

Therefore, the probability that our new colleague has risen to 50%.
