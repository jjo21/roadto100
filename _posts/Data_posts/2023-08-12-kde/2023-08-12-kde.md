While dealing with real world data, the data does not often follow a friendly statistical distribution. 
Don't let the fancy name scare you off – it's actually a super handy in visualising the probability distribution function 
and allow you to hypothesise what distribution the data follows.

Picture this: you've got a bunch of data points, and you want to get a sense of how they're spread out. 
Maybe it's the heights of your friends, the scores on your latest video game, or the amount of time you waste on social 
media every day. Whatever it is, you want to peek into the data and see those hidden patterns.

Here's the scoop on how KDE works: it places these little "kernel" functions at each data point. These kernels are like 
mini curves that represent the data's distribution around that point. Imagine you've got a bunch of hills on a landscape
– each hill is centered on a data point, and they all add up to create this smooth, rolling terrain that reflects the 
overall data distribution. 

What's really cool is that KDE lets you choose how wide or narrow those kernel curves should be. This is called the 
"bandwidth," and it's like adjusting the volume on your favorite playlist – you can make it super loud and bumpy, or 
smooth and mellow. A wider bandwidth means a smoother curve that might gloss over small bumps in your data, while a 
narrow one picks up every little wiggle.

Kernel density estimation is like the artist of the data science world. It takes your raw data and turns it into a 
masterpiece of smooth curves, helping you spot those hidden insights with ease. 


#### For a more in depth explanation:

An example of a kernel commonly used is the Gaussian kernel, given by the formula:

$$
f(x) = /frac{1}{/sigma/sqrt{2/pi}}/exp^{-/frac{1}{2}(/frac{x-/mu}{/sigma})^2}
$$
